* Sierpiński birds

#+attr_html: :alt Recursive bird-looking triangle-based patterns
[[./Sierpiński-birds.jpg]]

This drawing is a somewhat accidental hommage to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle][Sierpiński triangle]].
It started as a simple set of rules to establish an order in the subdivisions of the Sierpiński triangle.
When it occured to me to illustrate this order by simply drawing a line between one triangle and the next, I started to see those strange bird-like patterns emerge and I was inspired to find a way to make those patterns stand out, resulting in this drawing.
